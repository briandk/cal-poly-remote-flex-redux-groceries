With this pair exercise, we'll be learning how to implement the `Redux` system of state management into our React application. 

We will do so using `React-Redux`, a small additional library that binds Redux to React so you won't have to keep subscribing and unsubscribing manually.

* I recommend reading [this section](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html) of the `redux` docs to learn how to use `connect` so that you can hit the ground running.
