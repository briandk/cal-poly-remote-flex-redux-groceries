Today, we'll be creating a grocery list app using React and Redux. Here's the final product:

<h5>Starting Point</h5>

Head to [this github repo](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/PairExercise.ReduxGroceries) then fork, clone, and follow the setup instructions in the `README.md`.

The starting point contains:

1. A very simple express application that just serves the public folder (no database, no routes for now)
1. Webpack configuration & start scripts
1. One single React component (`/client/components/App.js`) that right now displays "Hello World".
