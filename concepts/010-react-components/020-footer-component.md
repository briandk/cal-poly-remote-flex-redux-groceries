In future steps, the `Footer` will contain links to filter the groceries, but we will begin with a simple functional component:

```js
import React from "react";

const Footer = () => (
  <div className="footer">
    Placeholder for footer
  </div>
);

export default Footer;
```

Copy and paste the footer component to your `/client/components/Footer.js` file than move on.
