For the remainder of this section, we will focus on putting together the ingredients of our Redux store so that it can manage our app's state, particularly our **array of grocery items**.

Start by installing Redux:

```bash
npm install redux
```

Next, create a new file called `store.js` in your `client/` folder.

As our app gets larger, we may write separate files to hold all of our different parts, but for now we'll keep everything in one file for simplicity.
