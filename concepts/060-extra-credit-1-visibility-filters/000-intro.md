Congratulations: if you reached this point it means you have a fully functional React & Redux application. You should be able to add groceries to the list and toggle them. 

But if we bring back the original animation of the complete project, you will see that something is missing:

![groceries list](https://learndotresources.s3.amazonaws.com/workshop/5a7a11b64df85500040c20ff/groceries.gif)

You next task is to create "Visibility Filters", that allow the user to see the ALL the groceries in the list, only the BOUGHT groceries or only the ACTIVE (as in "still have to buy").

You read and understood the above
